### <span style="color:#ff2595"> **Currently asdqewwrewrfasdas AI Engineer.** </span>
My goal is to create the best versions of myself and of the world.<br><br> 
My greatest strength is motivation, and my biggest flaw is over-analyzing. <br><br>
I'm 100% self taught, love to learn, and pick up skills very quickly. I've been coding for a little under a year, and it has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. I get to use every creative bone in my body to try to awe, entertain and inspire people. This is what makes me happy and why I'm so passionate! <br><br>
